## Camel Case

I used to write everything in this style, but it is kind of ugly.

`wordWord`

## Snake Case

I prefer this style for variables, because it is easier to read than camel case. And you have to use it for constants, so that you don't end up with something like `WORDWORD`.

`word_word`
`WORD_WORD`

## Kebab Case

I prefer this style for filenames.

`word-word`
`WORD-WORD`

## Sometimes I mix all 3 of them

**Example for naming projects:**  
`MainTopic_Project-Name`
